This notebook plots the comparative results for Column Density of H I and O VI separately. The tests included are: Mann Whiteney U Test, Student T, and KS 2 Sample. The plots are created by testing a variety of limits for the polar and disk regions. Initially we separated the disk and polar regions by polar being where the azimuthal angle is <45 and azimuthal angle in the disk>45. I range the possible polar region from 25-45 degrees and the possible disk region from 45-65 degrees to find the optimized angles to define each region. The notebook then displays the results as a function of the maximum (or edge) degree that defines the polar region, which is why the plots on the x axis will range from 25-45 degrees.

This specific notebook tests the statistical significance of our results with the ...

This is the plot I created to display a triple plot of:
